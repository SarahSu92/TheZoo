# Project Title

The Zoo, on the homepage, there should be a link to an animal page where visitors can see which animals are available, along with a short description of each animal and an image. Unfortunately, some of the animalsâ€™ images are incorrect, and these need to be handled in a good way.

When a user clicks on an animal, they are taken to an animal page where only one animal is presented. Here, there will be more information about the animal than on the overview page. 
On the animal page, there will be a button to feed the animal. The following rules apply for feeding an animal:

If an animal has not been fed for four hours, the Feed button should be clickable.

If an animal has been fed within the last four hours, the button should be unclickable.

When an animal has not been fed for three hours, an indication should be shown that the animal will soon need to be fed.

On the animal overview page, it should also be visible whether an animal is full, hungry, or in desperate need of food. But on this overview page, the timings are a little different compared to the detail page. The following applies:

If an animal has not been fed for three hours, a warning should be shown that the animal will soon need to be fed.

If an animal has not been fed for five hours, a notice should be shown that the animal now needs to be fed.
